"""Vectorised multi-squadron boids update.

One call resolves every fanboid in every squadron for one timestep. The rules
are stock Reynolds (1987): separation against everyone, cohesion and alignment
within your own squadron only.

WHY VECTORISED. The obvious implementation loops over boids and calls a
per-boid rule function. That is what this replaced, and it was the dominant
cost of the whole simulation -- not the arithmetic, the dispatch. NumPy costs
roughly a microsecond per call regardless of array size, so a per-boid loop
over 4-to-8-element arrays spends nearly all its time in overhead. Measured on
an 8391-step run: 569 us/step at 3 fans per squad and 1758 us/step at 12,
against 232 and 257 us/step for this version. Note the scaling, which is the
real point -- the loop version grows linearly in fanboid count, this one is
nearly flat.

    leadX/leadY/leadTh    : arrays over leaders, one per squadron
    returns               : (vxDes, vyDes), same shape as fanX

    Nothing here is hard-coded to two squadrons -- squadron membership is a
    mask comparison, so N squadrons is the same code.

    sepOnlyOnEncounter: suspend cohesion and alignment for a fanboid while any
    FOREIGN agent is within encounterRange.

    That switch is the fix for a specific failure. Cross-squadron coupling is
    already separation-only, because cohesion and alignment are fed same-squad
    neighbours only. The counter-productive term is a fanboid's OWN squadron:
    while two squadrons interpenetrate, cohesion pulls each boid back toward
    its squadmates' centre of mass and alignment pulls its heading back to the
    squad average, and both point straight back into the lane it is trying to
    separate out of. The rules cancel and the swerve never executes. Reynolds
    gives separation strict priority for exactly this reason.

    encounterRange: None -> opts.VR, the range cohesion and alignment act over
    anyway. Raising it above VR makes squadrons stop flocking EARLIER, which
    sounds backwards but gives each boid more runway to clear the lane before
    contact.
